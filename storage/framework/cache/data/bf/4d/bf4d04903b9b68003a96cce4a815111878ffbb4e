This computer reconstruction of the surface of Venus was created from data from the Magellan spacecraft.  Magellan orbited Venus and used radar to map our neighboring planet's surface between 1990 and 1994. Magellan found many interesting surface features, including the large circular domes, typically 25-kilometers across, that are depicted above.  Volcanism is thought to have created the domes, although the precise mechanism remains unknown. Venus' surface is so hot and hostile that no surface probe has lasted more than a few minutes.";s:5:"hdurl";s:56:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/venus4_mag_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:26:"Venus' Once Molten Surface";s:3:"url";s:52:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/venus4_mag.jpg";}i:1;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"1997-03-02";s:11:"explanation";s:840:"Aloha! With the graceful arc of the Earth's limb in the background, the entire Hawaiian Island archipelago is visible in this stunning photo taken by the astronauts onboard the shuttle Discovery in October of 1988. Along with popular beaches and tropical resorts, these volcanic islands offer extreme elevations with dark, dry, cloudless skies. Consequently they have also become popular sites for sophisticated ground based telescopes. The peak of Mauna Kea, on the Big Island (upper left), boasts an impressive array of astronomical instruments including the Keck, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the NASA IRTF, the JCMT and UKIRT, and the Gemini Telescope Project. The dormant volcanic cone of Haleakala on Maui (just below the Big Island) is home to the Air Force Maui Optical Station and the Mees Solar Observatory.

The above music video shows some of the highlights. In the first time-lapse sequence (00:07), a vertical line appears that is really Saturn's thin rings seen nearly edge-on.  Soon some of Saturn's moon shoot past.  The next sequence (00:11) features Saturn's unusually wavy F-ring that is constrained by the two shepherd moons that are also continually perturbing it.  Soon much of Saturn's extensive ring system flashes by, sometimes juxtaposed to the grandeur of the immense planet itself. Cloud patterns on Titan (00:39) and Saturn (00:41) are highlighted. Clips from flyby's of several of Saturn's moon are then shown, including Phoebe, Mimas, Epimetheus, and Iapetus. In other sequences, moons of Saturn appear to pass each other as they orbit Saturn. Background star fields seen by Cassini are sometimes intruded upon by bright passing moons.

The Canadarm2 aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  Canadarm2 has multiple joints and is capable of maneuvering payloads as massive as 116,000 kilograms, equivalent to a fully loaded bus.  Canadarm2 is operated by remote control by a human inside the  space station.  To help with tasks requiring a particularly high level of precision and detail, an astronaut can be anchored to an attached foot constraint.  The arm is able propel itself end-over-end around the outside of the space station. Pictured above, astronaut Stephen Robinson rides Canadarm2 during the STS-114 mission of the space shuttle Discovery to the ISS in 2005 August.   Space shuttles often deploy their own original version of a robotic arm dubbed Canadarm.

The tremendous heat generated by the collision of a small sand-bit moving at 70 kilometers/second with the Earth's upper atmosphere causes the rock-fragment to heat up, glow brightly, and disintegrate.  In some cases, the meteor literally explodes leaving a visible cloud that dissipates slowly.  The above image shows just such an explosion for a bright meteor from the recent Leonid Meteor Shower.  Clicking on the above image will start a (4.2 Megabtye) movie of thirty 1-minute exposures showing the explosion cloud dissipate.
