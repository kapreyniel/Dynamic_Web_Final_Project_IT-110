The Delta IV Heavy is the largest of the Delta series, packing the punch of three rocket boosters instead of the usual one. The resulting rocket, the most powerful in use by the US Air Force, is capable of lifting over 23,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit, comparable to NASA's Space Shuttle. Pictured above is the second launch of the Delta IV Heavy from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA in 2007, and the first night launch.  Complex service towers are visible to each side of the soaring rocket. The rocket successfully lifted a reconnaissance satellite to low Earth orbit. The Delta IV Heavy has since completed several more successful lift-offs, while its next launch is currently planned from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, USA, next month.";s:5:"hdurl";s:64:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1012/deltalaunch_cooper_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:26:"Launch of a Delta IV Heavy";s:3:"url";s:60:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1012/deltalaunch_cooper.jpg";}i:1;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:59:"P.

Since then, this erupting snowball continues to fall into our inner Solar System and is starting to put on quite a show. Comets have been known throughout history to show tails that spread across the sky.  In the above picture, the blue stream is the ion tail which consists of ions pushed away from the comet's head by the solar wind. The ion tail always points directly away from the Sun. Comet Hale-Bopp is now visible in the morning sky, moving a few degrees each day. Comet Hale-Bopp is expected to be at its best and brightest in late March and early April.";s:5:"hdurl";s:59:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9702/halebopp1_cvo_big.gif";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:31:"Comet Hale-Bopp Develops a Tail";s:3:"url";s:55:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9702/halebopp1_cvo.gif";}i:2;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:95:"

Volcanoes are breaks in the Earth's cool surface where hot liquid rock from the interior comes out -- sometimes suddenly. In the above image from the ASTER camera aboard NASA's orbiting Terra satellite, snow-capped volcanoes are seen from overhead that compose the picturesque Islands of the Four Mountains in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA. The islands contain restless Mt. Cleveland, an active volcano currently being watched to see if it emits an ash cloud that could affect air travel over parts of North America. A close look at Mt. Cleveland, seen near the image center, shows red vegetation (false color), a white snow-covered peak, a light plume of gas and ash, and dark lanes where ash and debris fell or flowed.  Millions of volcanoes have likely been active over the turbulent history of the Earth's surface, while about 20 volcanoes are erupting even today, at any given time.";s:5:"hdurl";s:59:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1006/islands_terra_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:36:"Islands of Four Mountains from Above";s:3:"url";s:55:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1006/islands_terra.jpg";}i:3;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:26:"

The star forming region above, known as Swan Nebula, is the home of hot red-glowing gas, dark lanes of dust, bright young stars and -- what are those?  Of the few stars visible in the Swan Nebula, several have quite unusual colors and are  hypothesized to be very young stars still shrouded by gas from the cloud that formed them. The Swan Nebula is quite large and massive as it contains roughly 1000 times the mass of our Sun. The bright central region is about 15 light years across lies about 5000 light years away toward the constellation of Sagittarius. The distinctive shape causes this region to have several other names, including the Omega Nebula, the Horseshoe Nebula, and the Lobster Nebula.";s:5:"hdurl";s:47:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/m17_wp_big.gif";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:29:"M17: The Majestic Swan Nebula";s:3:"url";s:43:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/m17_wp.gif";}i:4;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:19:"

Titled New Horizons, the painting also depicts Pluto's companion, Charon, as a darkened, ghostly apparition with a luminous crescent against a starry background. Beyond Charon, the diminished Sun is immersed in a flattened cloud of zodiacal dust. Here, Pluto's ruddy colors are based on existing astronomical observations while imagined but scientifically tenable details provided by the artist include high atmospheric cirrus and dark plumes from surface vents, in analogy to Neptune's large moon Triton explored by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989. Craters suggest bombardment by Kuiper Belt objects, a newly understood population of outer solar system bodies likely related to the Pluto-Charon system. NASA is now considering a future robotic reconnaissance mission to Pluto-Charon and the Kuiper Belt which could reach the distant worlds late in the next decade.";s:5:"hdurl";s:63:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0110/newhorizons_durda_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:19:"Pluto: New Horizons";s:3:"url";s:59:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0110/newhorizons_durda.jpg";}}
