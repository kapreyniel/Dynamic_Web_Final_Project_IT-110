Seen from a grassy hillside from Shiraz, Iran these Perseid meteors streak along the northern summer Milky Way before dawn on Sunday, August 13. Frames used to construct the composited image were captured near the active annual meteor shower's peak between 02:00 AM and 04:30 AM local time. Not in this night skyscape, the shower's radiant in the heroic constellation Perseus is far above the camera's field of view. But fans of northern summer nights can still spot a familiar asterism. Formed by bright stars Deneb, Vega, and Altair, the Summer Triangle spans the luminous band of the Milky Way.";s:5:"hdurl";s:50:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/MSH21080.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:27:"Meteors along the Milky Way";s:3:"url";s:50:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2308/MSH11080.jpg";}i:1;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:14:"

Adrift 1,500 light-years away in one of the night sky's most recognizable constellations, they appear in opposite corners of the above stunning two-panel mosaic. The familiar Horsehead nebula appears as a dark cloud on the lower left, a small silhouette notched against the glow of hydrogen (alpha) gas, here tinted orange.  Alnitak is the easternmost star in Orion's belt and can be found to the left of the Horsehead. Below Alnitak is the Flame Nebula, with clouds of bright emission and dramatic dark dust lanes. The magnificent emission region, the Orion Nebula (aka M42), lies at the upper right, surrounded by the blue glow of reflecting dust. Immediately to its left is a prominent reflection nebula sometimes called the Running Man. Pervasive tendrils of glowing hydrogen gas are easily traced throughout the region.";s:5:"hdurl";s:71:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1903/Horsehead2Nebula_Zauner_14173.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:27:"Horsehead and Orion Nebulas";s:3:"url";s:70:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1903/Horsehead2Nebula_Zauner_1080.jpg";}i:2;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:30:"Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope";s:4:"date";s:10:"2003-12-15";s:11:"explanation";s:957:"Open clusters of stars can be near or far, young or old, and diffuse or compact.  Open clusters may contain from 100 to 10,000 stars, all of which formed at nearly the same time.  Bright blue stars frequently distinguish younger open clusters.  M35, pictured above on the upper left, is relatively nearby at 2800 light years distant, relatively young at 150 million years old, and relatively diffuse, with about 2500 stars spread out over a volume 30 light years across.  An older and more compact open cluster, NGC 2158, is visible above on the lower right.  NGC 2158 is four times more distant that M35, over 10 times older, and much more compact as it contains many more stars in roughly the same volume of space.  NGC 2158's bright blue stars have self-destructed, leaving cluster light to be dominated by older and yellower stars.  Both clusters are visible toward the constellation of Gemini -- M35 with binoculars and NGC 2158 with a small telescope.";s:5:"hdurl";s:54:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/m35_cfht_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:35:"Open Star Clusters M35 and NGC 2158";s:3:"url";s:50:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/m35_cfht.jpg";}i:3;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"2008-11-19";s:11:"explanation";s:981:"What's causing this unusual aurora over Saturn? No one is sure. Infrared images by the robotic Cassini spacecraft of the north pole of Saturn have uncovered aurora unlike any other seen previously in our Solar System. The strange aurora are shown in blue in the above image, while the underlying clouds are shown in red.  The previously recorded, also-strange hexagon cloud patterns are visible in red below the aurora. These Saturnian aurora can cover the entire pole, while auroras around Earth and Jupiter are typically confined by magnetic fields to rings surrounding the magnetic poles. More normal auroral rings had been previously imaged around Saturn. The recently imaged strange auroras above Saturn's north pole can change their global patterns significantly in only a few minutes. The large and variable nature of these auroras indicate that charged particles streaming in from the Sun are experiencing some type of magnetism above Saturn that was previously unexpected.";s:5:"hdurl";s:69:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0811/saturnhexaurora_cassini_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:40:"Unusual Auroras Over Saturn's North Pole";s:3:"url";s:65:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0811/saturnhexaurora_cassini.jpg";}i:4;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"2006-05-15";s:11:"explanation";s:733:"What created this unusually textured rock on Mars?   Most probably: a volcano.   Dubbed Bumpy Boulder, the strange stone measuring just under a half-meter high was found by the robotic Spirit rover currently rolling across Mars.   Pits on the ragged rock are likely vesicles and arise from hot gas bubbling out of hot rock ejected by an active Martian volcano.   Several similar rocks are visible near Bumpy Boulder that likely have a similar past.  The above true-color image was taken about one month ago.   The Spirit rover, now in its third year of operation on Mars, is weathering the low sunlight winter of Mar's northern hemisphere on a hillside slope in order to maximize the amount of absorbable battery-refreshing sunlight.";s:5:"hdurl";s:65:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/bumpyboulder_spirit_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:30:"Volcanic Bumpy Boulder on Mars";s:3:"url";s:61:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/bumpyboulder_spirit.jpg";}}
