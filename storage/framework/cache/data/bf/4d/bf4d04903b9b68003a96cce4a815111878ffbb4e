Noted for the common beauty of its overall shape, parts of the Rosette Nebula, also known as NGC 2244, show beauty even when viewed up close.  Visible above are globules of dark dust and gas that are slowly being eroded away by the energetic light and winds by nearby massive stars.  Left alone long enough, the molecular-cloud globules would likely form stars and planets.  The above image was taken in very specific colors of  Sulfur (shaded red), Hydrogen (green), and Oxygen (blue). The Rosette Nebula spans about 50 light-years across, lies about 4,500 light-years away, and can be seen with a small telescope towards the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros).";s:5:"hdurl";s:64:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/rosette_torregrosa_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:37:"Dust Sculptures in the Rosette Nebula";s:3:"url";s:60:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/rosette_torregrosa.jpg";}i:1;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:17:"

In fact, the past 100 million years haven't been so good, and probably the next billion or so will be quite tumultuous.  Visible toward the lower right, NGC 4038 used to be a normal spiral galaxy, minding its own business, until NGC 4039, to its upper left, crashed into it.  The evolving wreckage, known famously as the Antennae, is featured here.  As gravity restructures each galaxy, clouds of gas slam into each other, bright blue knots of stars form, massive stars form and explode, and brown filaments of dust are strewn about.  Eventually the two galaxies will converge into one larger spiral galaxy. Such collisions are not unusual, and even our own Milky Way Galaxy has undergone several in the past and is predicted to collide with our neighboring Andromeda Galaxy in a few billion years. The frames that compose this image were taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope by professional astronomers to better understand galaxy collisions. These frames -- and many other deep space images from Hubble -- have since been made public, allowing interested amateurs to download and process them into, for example, this visually stunning composite.";s:5:"hdurl";s:69:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1805/Antennae_HubblePestana_4081.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:35:"Spiral Galaxy NGC 4038 in Collision";s:3:"url";s:68:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1805/Antennae_HubblePestana_960.jpg";}i:2;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"2001-03-25";s:11:"explanation";s:823:"The Crab Nebula, filled with mysterious filaments, is the result of a star that was seen to explode in 1054 AD.  This spectacular supernova explosion was recorded by Chinese and (quite probably) Anasazi Indian astronomers.  The filaments are mysterious because they appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and higher speed than expected from a free explosion. In the above picture taken recently from a Very Large Telescope, the color indicates what is happening to the electrons in different parts of the Crab Nebula. Red indicates the electrons are recombining with protons to form neutral hydrogen, while blue indicates the electrons are whirling around the magnetic field of the inner nebula.  In the nebula's very center lies a pulsar: a neutron star rotating, in this case, 30 times a second.";s:5:"hdurl";s:54:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9911/crab_vlt_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:24:"The Crab Nebula from VLT";s:3:"url";s:50:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9911/crab_vlt.jpg";}i:3;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:19:"

But amateur astronomer Marc-Andre Besel was impressed by the brilliant lighting displays that joined the first quarter Moon and stars of the constellation Scorpius in western skies. On August 22, 2004, his view looked across the Gulf of Mexico from Anna Maria Island, Florida, USA, a region that would experience even more stormy weather in the coming days.  The alluring digital image is a time exposure, by chance capturing the details of a brief flash of lightning along with an overexposed Moon and dramatic cloud formations. In fact, the exposure is long enough to show the background stars as short streaks or trails. The bright yellowish star trail, just above and right of the lightning flash, is red giant star Antares.";s:5:"hdurl";s:65:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0410/moonlightning_besel_f02.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:14:"Moon Lightning";s:3:"url";s:65:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0410/moonlightning_besel_c02.jpg";}i:4;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"2019-10-12";s:11:"explanation";s:978:"In an interplanetary first, on July 19, 2013 Earth was photographed on the same day from two other worlds of the Solar System, innermost planet Mercury and ringed gas giant Saturn. Pictured on the left, Earth is the pale blue dot just below the rings of Saturn, as captured by the robotic Cassini spacecraft then orbiting the outermost gas giant. On that same day people across planet Earth snapped many of their own pictures of Saturn. On the right, the Earth-Moon system is seen against the dark background of space as captured by the robotic MESSENGER spacecraft, then in Mercury orbit. MESSENGER took its image as part of a search for small natural satellites of Mercury, moons that would be expected to be quite dim. In the MESSENGER image, the Earth (left) and Moon (right) are overexposed and shine brightly with reflected sunlight. Destined not to return to their home world, both Cassini and MESSENGER have since retired from their missions of Solar System exploration.";s:5:"hdurl";s:69:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1910/earth_cassinimessenger_1799.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:20:"Interplanetary Earth";s:3:"url";s:70:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1910/earth_cassinimessenger_1024c.jpg";}}
