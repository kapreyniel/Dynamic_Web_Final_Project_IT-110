Commenting on his view from orbit he reported, "The sky is very dark; the Earth is bluish. Everything is seen very clearly". To celebrate, consider this recent image from the orbiting International Space Station. A stunning view of the planet at night from an altitude of 240 miles, it was recorded on March 28. The lights of Moscow, Russia are near picture center and one of the station's solar panel arrays is on the left. Aurora and the glare of sunlight lie along the planet's gently curving horizon. Stars above the horizon include the compact Pleiades star cluster, immersed in the auroral glow.";s:5:"hdurl";s:55:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1204/iss030e185321.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:13:"Yuri's Planet";s:3:"url";s:59:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1204/iss030e185321_900.jpg";}i:1;a:8:{s:9:"copyright";s:13:"

Scorpius more typically appears as a few bright stars in a well-known but rarely pointed out zodiacal constellation. To get a spectacular image like this, though, one needs a good camera, a dark sky, and some sophisticated image processing.  The resulting digitally-enhanced image shows many breathtaking features.  Diagonal across the image right is part of the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy.   Visible there are vast clouds of bright stars and long filaments of dark and intricate dust.  Rising vertically on the image left are dark dust bands known as the Dark River.  Several of the bright stars on the left are part of Scorpius' head and claws, and include the bright star Antares.  Numerous red emission nebulas, blue reflection nebulas, and dark filaments became visible as the deep 17-hour expo image developed. Scorpius appears prominently in southern skies after sunset during the middle of the year.";s:5:"hdurl";s:68:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2106/ScorpiusEnhanced_Lenz_5000.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:17:"Scorpius Enhanced";s:3:"url";s:68:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2106/ScorpiusEnhanced_Lenz_1080.jpg";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"date";s:10:"2010-12-15";s:11:"explanation";s:967:"Click the arrow and watch an unusually long filament explode out from the Sun.  The filament had been seen hovering over the Sun's surface for over a week before it erupted earlier this month.  The image sequence was taken by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in one color of ultraviolet light specifically emitted by helium, and another color of X-ray light specifically emitted by iron.  The explosion created Coronal Mass Ejections which dispersed high energy plasma into the Solar System.  This plasma cloud, though, missed the Earth and so did not cause auroras.  The above eruption and an unusually expansive eruption that occurred in August are showing how widely separated areas of the Sun can sometimes act in unison.  Explosions like this will likely become more common over the next few years as our Sun moves toward Solar Maximum activity.

Two weeks ago, the orbiting HETE satellite detected gamma-ray burst GRB030329.  The extremely bright burst was found hours later to have an extremely bright afterglow in visible light, and soon set the record for the closest measured distance at redshift 0.17.  The afterglow brightness allows unprecedented coverage of its evolution.  Just this week, as many astronomers suspected would happen, the afterglow began to appear as a fading Type II Supernova.  Type II Supernovas might not appear coincident with gamma-ray bursts, however, when the gamma-ray beam goes in another direction.  The above spiral galaxy, NGC 3184, was home to a Type II Supernova in 1999 at the position of the arrow.  Astronomers are currently pressing hard to find the host galaxy for GRB030329.";s:5:"hdurl";s:59:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0304/ngc3184_kelly_big.jpg";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:40:"A Gamma Ray Burst - Supernova Connection";s:3:"url";s:55:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0304/ngc3184_kelly.jpg";}i:4;a:7:{s:4:"date";s:10:"1997-06-26";s:11:"explanation";s:1111:"The unassuming star centered in this sky view will one day be our next door stellar neighbor. The faint 9th magnitude red dwarf currently 63 light-years away in the constellation Ophiucus was recently discovered to be on a course toward our Solar System. Known in catalogs of nearby stars as Gliese 710 it is predicted to come within 1 light-year of the Sun ... a million years from now. At that distance this star, presently much too faint to be seen by the naked eye, will blaze at 0.6 magnitude - rivaling the apparent brightness of the mighty red giant Antares. Gliese 710 poses no direct collision danger itself although its gravitational influence will likely scatter comets out of the Solar System's reservoir, the Oort cloud, sending some inbound. This future stellar encounter was discovered by researchers Joan Garcia-Sanchez and Robert Preston (JPL), and collaborators while studying stars in the solar neighborhood using data from the Hipparcos Astrometry Satellite. The star field shown is based on the Palomar Digitized Sky Survey and is 1/4 degree wide (about half the diameter of the full moon).";s:5:"hdurl";s:55:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/gl710_skyview.gif";s:10:"media_type";s:5:"image";s:15:"service_version";s:2:"v1";s:5:"title";s:37:"A Close Encounter of the Stellar Kind";s:3:"url";s:55:"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/gl710_skyview.jpg";}}
